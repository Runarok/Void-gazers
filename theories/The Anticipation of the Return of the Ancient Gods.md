# The Anticipation of the Return of the Ancient Gods

In H.P. Lovecraft’s works, one of the most compelling and terrifying themes is the concept of ancient, god-like beings lying dormant, waiting for the right moment to return to the world. These gods, such as **Cthulhu**, **Nyarlathotep**, and **Azathoth**, are often depicted as being beyond human perception and comprehension, existing in a realm that defies human understanding. These entities are not merely creatures of immense power; they represent a fundamental aspect of the **cosmic order**, one where humanity is insignificant, and our existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand timeline of the universe.

## Ancient Cosmology: Humanity’s Insignificance

The idea that ancient, god-like beings exist beyond human comprehension suggests a **cosmology** in which humanity’s role is minuscule. In Lovecraft’s universe, human civilization is just a brief blip in the vast timeline of cosmic existence, overshadowed by forces that are so alien, powerful, and ancient that they exist outside of human time and understanding. These entities were here before humanity, and they will remain long after humanity is gone. The sheer scale of this **cosmic indifference** is a core theme of Lovecraftian horror.

### The Ancient Gods and Their Waiting

The ancient gods in Lovecraft’s works are not typically omnipotent or all-knowing in the way many deities in other mythologies are depicted. Rather, these beings are **inactive** or **slumbering**, waiting for the right cosmic alignment or event to allow them to reawaken and reclaim their dominion over Earth and the universe. This waiting period may span eons, and these gods’ eventual return is often seen as inevitable—a force of nature that no human action can prevent.

For example:

- **Cthulhu**, perhaps the most famous of Lovecraft’s ancient gods, lies dormant beneath the ocean in the sunken city of **R’lyeh**, waiting for the stars to align so that he can return to the Earth. In *The Call of Cthulhu*, the cult of Cthulhu anticipates his return and believes that his awakening will herald the end of the human race and the beginning of a new era.
- **Nyarlathotep**, also known as the Crawling Chaos, is a shape-shifting, malevolent force that moves throughout the world, often causing madness and chaos. Unlike the slumbering Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep is awake, yet it still serves the greater purpose of the ancient cosmic order, sometimes acting as a messenger or harbinger of destruction.

The anticipation of these beings’ return is a recurring theme, creating a sense of looming dread and inevitability, as though humanity is powerless in the face of a **cosmic cycle** that will unfold regardless of human intervention.

## The End of Human Civilization

The return of these ancient gods is often linked with the **end of human civilization**. In Lovecraft's view, humanity is nothing more than a temporary blip on the radar of a vast, uncaring cosmos. The eventual return of these beings would signify the **dissolution of human society** and potentially the **extinction** of the human race. It is not merely a cataclysmic event; it is a cosmic event that resets the natural order, returning the universe to a state before humanity's existence, and potentially beyond comprehension.

This theme plays out in several key works:

- **The Call of Cthulhu**: In this story, the discovery of Cthulhu’s cult and the signs of his return suggest that the ancient being will soon rise and reassert his control over the Earth. The cult's followers believe that humanity’s time is up, and the gods will soon reclaim their rightful place in the cosmos.
- **At the Mountains of Madness**: In this novella, the protagonists discover ancient ruins and artifacts of a race known as the **Elder Things**, who existed long before humanity. These beings' origins and connection to the universe are so vast and incomprehensible that the revelation causes existential terror. The characters learn that their discovery represents just one of many ancient, god-like entities that once ruled the Earth and that they are but a small part of a much larger, indifferent cosmic history.

In these stories, the **anticipation** of the gods' return is marked by fear, awe, and helplessness. The human race, despite its technological and intellectual advancements, is powerless in the face of cosmic forces that are **beyond** its understanding and control.

## The Dissolution of Humanity’s Place in the Cosmos

The return of the ancient gods represents a profound shift in the **cosmic hierarchy**, one in which humanity no longer holds any central place. In many ways, the realization that these gods are waiting to return serves as a harsh reminder that humanity is not at the top of the cosmic food chain. We are fragile, insignificant beings in a universe governed by forces so alien and vast that they are completely beyond our ability to comprehend.

### Cosmic Horror and Human Fragility

The core of the **cosmic horror** genre is the idea that human existence is inconsequential when measured against the grand scale of the universe. The return of the ancient gods marks the dissolution of human relevance and the tragic realization that humans are not masters of the universe, but merely fleeting inhabitants of a universe that will continue with or without us.

This dissolution of humanity’s place in the cosmos leads to themes of **existential dread** and **futility**. In Lovecraft's universe, even our best efforts—our civilizations, our achievements—are meaningless in the face of the cosmic order. The return of the ancient gods may not just mark the end of human civilization, but the end of **humanity’s story entirely**.

## The Impact of This Theme in Modern Media

The anticipation of the return of ancient gods, and the eventual dissolution of humanity’s place in the universe, remains a powerful theme in cosmic horror. **Films like *Annihilation* and *The Mist***, as well as video games like *Bloodborne* and *Dark Souls*, explore similar ideas of encountering ancient, god-like entities that threaten the existence of humanity. These works often tap into the sense that there is a much greater, darker truth lurking beneath the surface of our reality—one that humanity is simply not meant to understand or survive.
