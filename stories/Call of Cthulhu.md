## **Call of Cthulhu - Brief Overview**

*Call of Cthulhu* is a short story written by H.P. Lovecraft, first published in 1928. It is one of his most famous works and introduces the concept of Cthulhu, an ancient cosmic entity that lies dormant beneath the ocean. The story is told through the fragmented accounts of various individuals who have encountered the mysterious cult worshipping Cthulhu. The tale explores themes of forbidden knowledge, insanity, and the insignificance of humanity in the vast universe.

The story is central to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe of cosmic horrors, and has inspired countless adaptations, games, and discussions around the concept of "cosmic horror" â€” the idea that the universe is vast, indifferent, and terrifying.
