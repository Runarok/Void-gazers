# Call of Cthulhu - Brief Overview

*Call of Cthulhu* is a short story written by **H.P. Lovecraft**, first published in 1928. It is one of his most influential works and introduces the concept of **Cthulhu**, a cosmic entity that has been dormant for eons beneath the ocean. The story unfolds through the fragmented accounts of different individuals who have encountered Cthulhu's cult and witnessed the horrors tied to this ancient being. 

The tale delves into **themes of forbidden knowledge**, **insanity**, and **humanity's insignificance** in a vast, indifferent universe. It is considered a cornerstone of Lovecraft's *Cthulhu Mythos*, a shared universe that explores the genre of **cosmic horror** â€” the belief that the universe is beyond human comprehension and full of terrifying, uncaring forces.

### Key Elements:
- **Cthulhu**: An ancient, gigantic, and terrifying entity that is part-octopus, part-dragon, and part-human, said to be lying dormant beneath the sea, waiting for the right time to rise again.
- **The Cult of Cthulhu**: A secretive, dangerous group of followers who worship Cthulhu and believe its return will herald the end of the world as we know it.
- **Cosmic Horror**: The concept that humanity is utterly insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe and that knowledge of the truth can drive a person to madness.
